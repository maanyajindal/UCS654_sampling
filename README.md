## Steps

### 1. Load the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using Python libraries.

### 2. Split the Dataset
The data is divided into **training** and **testing**.

### 3. Define Sampling Techniques
Different sampling methods are applied. 

### 4. Define Machine Learning Models
Multiple machine learning models are used to compare performance, including:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

### 5. Train and Evaluate Models
Each model is trained on the resampled dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as **accuracy**.

### 6. Display Results
Final performance scores for each sampling technique and model combination are displayed.
